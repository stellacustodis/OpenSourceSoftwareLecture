Welcome to my GitHub page!
I studied Deep Learning and Computer Vision at VCL of Seoultech University. 



I am currently in 3rd grade, going through an integrated bachelor's and master's program. 
I don't have enough experience to fill out my profile yet, but I'll try to fill it out little by little.

Thank you!
